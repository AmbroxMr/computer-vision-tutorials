This repository provides a structured collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to teach the core concepts of Computer Vision through practical, easy-to-follow Python examples.

## Requirements

All requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. This also includes the installation of Jupyter Notebook and OpenCV.
You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

The notebooks are organized into chapters. Each chapter focuses on a specific topic from image processing basics to advanced subjects like stereoscopic vision and 3D reconstruction.

To execute the notebooks, you can use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Start Jupyter by running:

```bash
python -m jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to the desired notebook and start learning!
